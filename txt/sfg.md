Specific description of the SFG
-------------------------------

The project aims at interesting data collection of natural conversations through gamification.
The dialogues are interesting, because they will represent navigation conversations in the real world.
To achive that goal, the game is designed to place users on fictional world, which is very similar to ours.
The game-format is choosed to interest more people to participate in this project

Game description:


HTML5 navigation game, which will collect user dialogues, to help improve route navigation services.

"Run Neo, Run"
Game is based on popular film series "The Matrix". 
The game is played by 2 players.
One of them takes role of the runner, who escapes from agents. He also has a limited view of the map. 
The second player as a navigator show the runner a way how to escape.
Therefore he is able to see the whole map. 

Game play is trivial. 
The team of two players win, if runner exits the matrix using telephone booth, otherwise he will be caught by agents and loses. 
Communication between navigator and runner is essential to win the game, because runner doesn't know the exit way in a maze which is hard to navigate.


The current state of research 
-----------------------------


The use of games is well attested in natural language processing and dialogue systems research.
One recent, high profile example is Watson (Ferrucci et al., 2010), a question-answering system developed by researchers at IBM that competes in the game of Jeopardy! against human players.
The game was used to focus on research challenges posed by rapidly answering open-domain English language questions in a competitive setting.
More broadly, a range of different corpora of participant interactions in games and tasks has facilitated dialogue system research, including work on natural language understanding and generation, turn-taking, dialogue management, and other areas; for a few recent examples see (Fernandez et al., 2007; Gravano and Hirschberg, 2009; Koller et al., 2010; Campana etal., 2012).
Research on rapid dialogue games by Maike Paetzel, David Nicolas Racca, David DeVault (University of Southern California, Institute for Creative Technologies) shown how dialogues from games can provide interesting data for future research in incremental speech processing techniques for spoken dialogue systems.

Another research, that is similar to our project, is "The Challenge on Generating Instructions in Virtual Environments"(GIVE).
GIVE is  approach to the notoriously hard problem of evaluating NLG systems.
Users connect to the generation systems over the Internet.
By logging how well they were able to follow the system's instructions, we can evaluate the quality of these instructions in terms of task completion rates and times, subjective measures such as helpfulness and friendliness, and runtime performance.
Because the user and the system don't need to be physically in the same place, access to experimental subjects over the Internet becomes easy.
GIVE has been shown to provide results that are consistent with, but more detailed than, ones obtained from a traditional lab-based evaluation.

Other related project is a mobile dialogue system (an Android app) called Spacebook, that addresses the problem of pedestrian navigation and tourist information in urban environments.
Where dialogue part is implemented by QA module (user-system).
Their users judged Spacebook significantly more interesting to interact with and learn from, than existing mobile apps which treat QA and GIS independently.
