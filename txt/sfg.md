Goals of the SFG, including a deadline for realization and the date of completion of the SFG
----------------------

The project aims at interesting data collection of natural conversations through gamification.
Why interesting? Why natural? Why gamification?

The main goal of this project is to collect useful data. At least 1000 of interesting dialogues.

(deadline for realization and the date of completion of the SFG?)


Specific description of the SFG
---------------------


HTML5 navigation game, which will collect user dialogues, to help improve route navigation services.


Game description:
"Run Neo, Run"
Game is based on popular film series "The Matrix". 
The game is played by 2 players.
One of them takes role of the runner, who escapes from agents. He also has a limited view of the map. 
The second player as a navigator show the runner a way how to escape. Therefore he is able to see the whole map. 

Game play is trivial. 
The team of two players win, if runner exits the matrix using telephone booth, otherwise he will be caught by agents and loses. 
Communication between navigator and runner is essential to win the game, because runner doesn't know the exit way in a maze which is hard to navigate.


The current state of the project
-----------------------

For now, the game has a prototype of the navigator's map...

**Promise of the future**
