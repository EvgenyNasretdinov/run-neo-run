Specific description of the SFG
---------------------

HTML5 navigation game, which will collect user dialogues, to help improve route navigation servicies.

Game description:
"Run Neo, Run"
Game is based on popular film series "The Matrix". Usually is played by 2 players. One of them tooks role of the runner, who escapes from agents and has limited view of the map. The Second one navigates the runner, and has whole map in touch. Players win, if runner exits the matrix using telephone booth, else he will be caught by agents. Communication between navigator and runner is necessary to win the game, because runner doesn't know the exit positons.
