Specific description of the SFG
---------------------

The project aims at interesting data collection of natural conversations through gamification.
The dialogues are interesting, because they will represent navigation conversations in the real world.
To achive that goal, the game is designed to place users on fictional world, which is very similar to ours.
The game-format is choosed to interest more people to participate in this project

Game description:


HTML5 navigation game, which will collect user dialogues, to help improve route navigation services.

"Run Neo, Run"
Game is based on popular film series "The Matrix". 
The game is played by 2 players.
One of them takes role of the runner, who escapes from agents. He also has a limited view of the map. 
The second player as a navigator show the runner a way how to escape. Therefore he is able to see the whole map. 

Game play is trivial. 
The team of two players win, if runner exits the matrix using telephone booth, otherwise he will be caught by agents and loses. 
Communication between navigator and runner is essential to win the game, because runner doesn't know the exit way in a maze which is hard to navigate.


The current state of the project
-----------------------

For now, the game has a prototype of the navigator's map...

**Promise of the future**



Similar prooject was implemented by Maike Paetzel, David Nicolas Racca, David DeVault (University of Southern California,
Institute for Creative Technologies)
They implemented several rapid dialogue games, and made some [research](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/697_Paper.pdf) on collected data.
